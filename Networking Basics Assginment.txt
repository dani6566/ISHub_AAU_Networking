Networking Basics – Comprehensive Questions
Networking Concepts
1. Define a computer network. What are its main purposes? 
A computer network is a group of connected computers and devices that share information and resources.
Main purposes:
-Share data like files
-Share resources like printer
-Enable communication like emails
-Improve efficiency by working together over the network.
2. What is the difference between LAN, WAN, MAN, and PAN? Provide one example of each 
LAN: Local Area Network
 - Covers a small geographical area(office, home, school).
 - Connects computers and devices within the same location.
 - Ex. Computer lab in a university
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
-Covers a city or large campus
-Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.
-Ex. City-wide fiber optic network  
WAN: Wide Area Network
-Covers a large geographical area like cities or countries.
-connects multiple LANs using public
-Ex. The Internet
PAN – Personal Area Network
-Very small area (usually within 10 meters).
-Used for communication between personal devices.
-Often uses Bluetooth or USB.
-Ex: Smartphone connected to wireless.
3. Explain client-server and peer-to-peer network models with examples 
Client-Server Network Model is Centralized control.
-The server provides services or resources and 
-The clients request and use them.
-Example: A school computer lab where students (clients) access files or print documents through a central server.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network Model is Decentralized and no central server.
-All computers are equal and can act as both clients and servers. 
-Each device can share files directly with others.
Example: File sharing using BitTorrent, where users upload and download files from each other’s computers.
4. What are the benefits of using a network in an organization? 
-File Sharing: Easy access and sharing of data between employees.
-Communication: Fast internal communication through emails, chats, or video calls.
-Security: Controlled access to sensitive information.

12. Compare STP and UTP cables. 
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) cables include an additional metallic shield for better protection against electromagnetic interference and crosstalk, making them more expensive and less flexible but suitable for high-interference areas.
- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables lack this shield, making them cheaper, more flexible, and commonly used in general Ethernet networks despite being more susceptible to interference.
13. What are BNC and RJ45 connectors used for?

  Ex., traditional radio broadcasts, TV broadcasts
- Half-duplex communication allows two-way data flow, but only in one direction at a time; devices must take turns transmitting and receiving.
  Ex. walkie-talkies
- Full-duplex communication enables simultaneous two-way data flow, allowing both devices to transmit and receive data at the same time.
  Ex. telephone conversations, modern Ethernet networks
20.What are the key components of a basic communication system?

- Medium/Channel – The path or transmission medium
- Protocol – Rules that control communication
21. Why are protocols important in communication?
- A protocol in a communication model is essential because it defines the rules and conventions for data exchange between devices.
 - Protocols ensure that devices can:
  - Understand each other (by using a common language).
  - Communicate efficiently and securely.
  - Handle errors and retransmissions when necessary.

 - The subnet mask of /26 is 255.255.255.192.
 - It supports 62 hosts.
 -Number of host bits = 32 - 26 = 6 bits.
 -Number of hosts = 2 ^ (6) - 2 = 62 hosts
37.Calculate the network and broadcast address of 192.168.20.0/27. 
 - Network Address: 192.168.20.0
 A /27 means 3 bits are borrowed for the subnet in the last octet, leaving 5 bits for hosts.
 The block size for /27 in the last octet is 2 
 2 ^ (32-27)  =2  ^ 5 = 32.
 -The subnets in the 192.168.20.x range will be 192.168.20.0, 192.168.20.32, 192.168.20.64, etc.
 Since the given address is 192.168.20.0, it is the start of a subnet.
 - Broadcast Address: 192.168.20.31
-The next subnet starts at 192.168.20.32, so the broadcast address for 192.168.20.0/27 is one less than that, which is 192.168.20.31.
38.From a /24 network, how many subnets can you create by borrowing 3 bits?
 - From a /24 network, by borrowing 3 bits, you can create 8 subnets.
  Number of subnets  = 2 ^ (number of borrowed bits) = 2 ^ 3 = 8
MAC Address and ARP
39.What is a MAC address and how is it different from an IP address? 
 - A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique, physical hardware address assigned by the manufacturer to each network interface for local network communication, 
 - An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a logical, software-configured address that enables communication across different networks and can be dynamic or static.
40.What is ARP and what is its role in networking?
 - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol that maps an IP address to a physical MAC address within a local network, playing the crucial role of enabling devices to discover the necessary MAC address for data transmission when only an IP address is known.

 It primarily operates on port 80.
42.What is DNS? What problem does it solve in networking? 
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, solving the problem of users having to remember complex numerical IP addresses for accessing network resources.
43.Define DHCP. How does it help in IP configuration? 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol that automates and centralizes the distribution of network configuration parameters like IP addresses to connected devices, significantly simplifying IP configuration.

- Ethernet defines the physical and data link layer specifications for wired LAN.
Switching and Routing
45.What is the difference between switching and routing?
 - Switching involves forwarding data frames within the same local network segment based on MAC addresses at the Data Link Layer.
 - Routing involves forwarding data packets between different networks based on IP addresses at the Network Layer.
46.Define VLAN. What is its purpose in a network?
 - A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical grouping of network devices that are not restricted by physical location, serving the purpose of improving network performance by reducing broadcast traffic, enhancing security.
Security Basics
47.What is default gateway and why is it important?
- The default gateway is the IP address of the router on a local network that acts as the exit point for all traffic destined for other networks, making it  devices to access the internet and communicate with resources outside their local subnet.
48.Name three common types of network threats.
Three common types of network threats include 
- Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt or gain unauthorized access. 
-phishing  where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
-Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which aim to make network services unavailable by overwhelming them with traffic.
49.What is a firewall? How does it protect a network?
- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls network traffic based on security rules, protecting a network by filtering traffic, preventing unauthorized access, blocking malicious content, and enforcing security policies.
50.What is the role of antivirus software in networking?
The role of antivirus software in networking is to protect individual devices connected to the network by detecting, preventing, and removing malicious software.

BONUS
Explain what NAT (Network Address Translation) is and where it is commonly used.
NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method that reassigns IP address information in packet headers, allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet, and it is commonly used in home and small office networks as well as by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
