Part A – IP Addressing Basics 
1. What is an IP address and why is it important in a network? 
IP Address is Internet Protocol Address that a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network Used to locate and communicate between devices
2. Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 in terms of: 
IPv4
Address length: 32-bit address
Notation format: Written in decimal, separated by dots
Number of available addresses: Approximately 4.3×10^9(about 4.3 billion)
Example: 192.168.1.1
IPv6
Address length: 128-bit address
Notation format: Written in hexadecimal, separated by colons
Number of available addresses: Approximately 3.4×10^38
Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
3. Write the binary equivalent of the IPv4 address 192.168.10.1. 
-Answer: 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001
4. Convert the following binary IP address to decimal: 
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000010 
-Answer: 192.168.1.2
5. What are the ranges of Class A, B, and C IPv4 addresses? 
-Class A range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
-Class B range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
-Class C range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
6. Which IP class does the address 172.16.5.4 belong to? 
Answer:  It's Private IP address range within Class B that used inside local networks not accessible directly from the internet.
7. What is the difference between public IP and private IP? List private IP ranges. 
-Public IP is assigned by ISP, accessible from the internet that used for websites, servers
-Private IP is used inside local networks that not accessible directly from the internet
-Common private IP ranges:
-10.x.x.x
-172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x
-192.168.x.x
8. What is the role of loopback address in IP networking? 
-Used for testing on your own device.
9. Explain the use of static IP vs dynamic IP with examples. 
Static IP is a permanent, unchanging IP address. Use for devices that need to be consistently found, like servers (web, email) or network printers.
Benefit: Reliable for inbound connections and remote access.
Dynamic IP is a temporary IP address assigned by a DHCP server. It can change. Use for most client devices (laptops, phones) and typical home internet connections. 
Benefit: Automatic configuration and efficient IP address reuse.
10. What is the default subnet mask for: 
- Class A ? 255.0.0.0
- Class B ? 255.255.0.0
- Class C ? 255.255.255.0
Part B – Subnetting Concepts & Calculations 
11. What is Subnetting and why is it used?
-Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller sub networks (subnets). 
-Helps improve network performance, security, and management.
12. Given the IP address 192.168.1.0/24, how many total IP addresses are available?
-for /24 network: 2^(32-24)=2^8 =256
- 256 Total IP address available 
13. From question 12, how many usable host IPs are there? 
- In a /24 network, there are 256 total IP addresses. but two addresses are reserved: one for the network address and one for the broadcast address. Therefore, the number of usable host IPs is 256?2=254.
14. How many subnets can be created from a /24 network if you borrow 2 bits? 
Answer: 2^2=4 subnet can be created.
15. What will be the new subnet mask if you borrow 3 bits from a /24 network? 
Answer: The new subnet mask will be 255.255.255.224. 
16. Given IP: 192.168.10.0/26 
- How many hosts per subnet? 
Answer: /26 network means 26 network bits, leaving 32?26=6 host bits.
-Number of hosts per subnet = 2 ^ (number of host bits) ?2=2 ^ 6 ?2=64?2=62.
- How many subnets can be created? 
Answer: borrowed 2 bits for the subnet (26?24=2).
- Number of subnets = 2 ^ (number of borrowed bits) = 2^2=4. 
17. Calculate the first and last usable IP address in the subnet 192.168.10.64/26. 
-First usable IP address: 192.168.10.65
-Last usable IP address: 192.168.10.126
18. Identify the network address and broadcast address of 10.0.0.0/22. 
Network address: 10.0.0.0
Broadcast address: 10.0.3.255
19. Fill in the blanks: 
- CIDR /30 gives __2 __usable IP addresses. 
* Total IP = 2 ^ (32?30) = 2 ^ 2 = 4. 
*Usable IPs = 4?2=2.
- CIDR /28 supports __14__ hosts per subnet. 
*Total IPs = 2 ^ (32?28) = 2 ^ 4 =16.
*Usable hosts = 16?2=14.
20. You are given the address block 172.16.0.0/20. 
- How many subnets can be created if you want each subnet to support at most 510 hosts? 
First find the CIDR prefix needed to support at most 510 hosts
We need 2^(n) – 2 >= 510 , n = 9.So we need 9 host bits.
The new CIDR prefix will be 32 – 9 = 23 => /23
The original network is /20
The number of borrowed bits is 23 – 20 = 3 bits.
Number of subnets = 2 ^ (number of borrowed bits) = 2 ^ 3 = 8 subnets.
- What will be the subnet mask? 
* /23 network subnet mask is 
In binary: 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000
In decimal: 255.255.254.0
